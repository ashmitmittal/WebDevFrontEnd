				<h2>Fire</h2>
				<p>
					Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical
					process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction
					products. Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not
					included by this definition.

				<h2>Water</h2>
				<p>
					Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly
					colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's
					hydrosphere, and the fluids of most living organisms. It is vital for
					all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or
					organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H2O, meaning that each of
					its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by
					covalent bonds. Water is the name of the liquid state of H2O at
					standard ambient temperature and pressure. It forms precipitation in
					the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds are formed
					from suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state.

				<h2>Ice</h2>
				<p>
					In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as
					close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects.
					Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice. It is abundant
					on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the
					snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition,
					plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate. It falls as
					snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes.
